title: Getting Started with Self-Hosting
---

Self-hosting Judgment Labs' platform is a great way to have full control over your LLM evaluation infrastructure. Instead of using our hosted platform, you can deploy your own instance of Judgment Labs' platform.

## Part 1: Infrastructure Skeleton Setup
Please have the following infrastructure set up:
1. A new/empty AWS account that you have admin access to. Please note down the account ID.
2. A Supabase organization that you have admin access to.

## Part 2: Request Self-Hosting Access from Judgment Labs

Please contact us at [support@judgmentlabs.ai](mailto:support@judgmentlabs.ai) with the following information:

- The name of your organization
- An image of your organization's logo
- [Optional] A subtitle for your organization
- Domain name for your self-hosted instance (e.g. api.organization.com) (can be any domain/subdomain name you own; this domain will be linked to your self-hosted instance as part of the setup process)
- The AWS account ID from Part 1
- Purpose of self-hosting

We will review your request and get back to you ASAP with a backend Osiris API key that will be input as part of the setup process using the Judgment CLI (Part 3).

## Part 3: Setting Up Your Self-Hosted Environment

For detailed instructions on setting up your self-hosted environment, please refer to the [self-hosting page](../judgment_cli/self-hosting) in the CLI section. This guide will walk you through the prerequisites, deployment process, and HTTPS listener setup for your self-hosted instance.
