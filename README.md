## Judgeval Overview

Judgeval is an open-source framework for agent behavior monitoring. Judgeval offers a toolkit to track and judge agent behavior in online and offline setups, enabling you to convert interaction data from production/test environments into improved agents. To get started, try running one of the notebooks below or dive deeper in our [docs](https://docs.judgmentlabs.ai/documentation).

Our mission is to unlock the power of production data for agent development, enabling teams to improve their apps by catching real-time failures and optimizing over their users' preferences.

## Why Judgeval?

⚙️ **Custom Evaluators**: No restriction to only monitoring with prefab scorers. Judgeval provides simple abstractions for custom python evaluators and their applications, supporting any LLM-as-a-judge rubrics/models and code-based scorers that integrate to our live agent-tracking infrastructure. [Learn more](https://docs.judgmentlabs.ai/documentation/evaluation/scorers/custom-scorers)

🚨 **Production Monitoring**: Run any custom scorer in a hosted, virtualized secure container to flag agent behaviors online in production. Get Slack alerts for failures and add custom hooks to address regressions before they impact users. [Learn more](https://docs.judgmentlabs.ai/documentation/performance/online-evals)

📊 **Behavior/Topic Grouping**: Group agent runs by behavior type or topic for deeper analysis. Drill down into subsets of users, agents, or use cases to reveal patterns of agent behavior.

TODO: Once we have trainer code docs, plug in here

🧪 **Experiment with evals**: Try out different prompts, models, or agent configs, then test for improvement with any agent behavior evaluator. Visualize and compare results over time! [Learn more](https://docs.judgmentlabs.ai/documentation/evaluation/introduction)

## 🛠️ Quickstart

Get started with Judgeval by installing our SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install judgeval
```

Ensure you have your `JUDGMENT_API_KEY` and `JUDGMENT_ORG_ID` environment variables set to connect to the [Judgment Platform](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/).

```bash
export JUDGMENT_API_KEY=...
export JUDGMENT_ORG_ID=...
```

**If you don't have keys, [create an account for free](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/register) on the platform!**

### Start monitoring with Judgeval

```python
from judgeval.tracer import Tracer, wrap
from judgeval.data import Example
from judgeval.scorers import AnswerRelevancyScorer
from openai import OpenAI


judgment = Tracer(project_name="default_project")
client = wrap(OpenAI())  # tracks all LLM calls

@judgment.observe(span_type="tool")
def format_question(question: str) -> str:
    # dummy tool
    return f"Question : {question}"

@judgment.observe(span_type="function")
def run_agent(prompt: str) -> str:
    task = format_question(prompt)
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4.1",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": task}]
    )

    judgment.async_evaluate(  # trigger online monitoring
        scorer=AnswerRelevancyScorer(threshold=0.5),  # swap with any scorer
        example=Example(input=task, actual_output=response),  # customize to your data
        model="gpt-5",
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

run_agent("What is the capital of the United States?")
```

Running this code will deliver monitoring results to your [free platform account](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/register) and should look like this:

### Customizable Scorers Over Agent Behavior

Judgeval's strongest suit is the full customization over the types of scorers you can run online monitoring with. No restrictions to only single-prompt LLM judges or prefab scorers - if you can express your scorer
in python code, judgeval can monitor it! Under the hood, judgeval hosts your scorer in a virtualized secure container, enabling online monitoring for any scorer.


First, create a behavior scorer in a file called `helpfulness_scorer.py`:

```python
from judgeval.data import Example
from judgeval.scorers.example_scorer import ExampleScorer

# Define custom example class
class QuestionAnswer(Example):
    question: str
    answer: str

# Define a server-hosted custom scorer
class HelpfulnessScorer(ExampleScorer):
    name: str = "Helpfulness Scorer"
    server_hosted: bool = True  # Enable server hosting
    async def a_score_example(self, example: QuestionAnswer):
        # Custom scoring logic for agent behavior
        # Can be an arbitrary combination of code and LLM calls
        if len(example.answer) > 10 and "?" not in example.answer:
            self.reason = "Answer is detailed and provides helpful information"
            return 1.0
        else:
            self.reason = "Answer is too brief or unclear"
            return 0.0
```

Then deploy your scorer to Judgment's infrastructure:

```bash
echo "pydantic" > requirements.txt
judgeval upload_scorer helpfulness_scorer.py requirements.txt
```

Now you can instrument your agent with monitoring and online evaluation:

```python
from judgeval.tracer import Tracer, wrap
from helpfulness_scorer import HelpfulnessScorer, QuestionAnswer
from openai import OpenAI

judgment = Tracer(project_name="default_project")
client = wrap(OpenAI())  # tracks all LLM calls

@judgment.observe(span_type="tool")
def format_task(question: str) -> str:  # replace with your prompt engineering
    return f"Please answer the following question: {question}"

@judgment.observe(span_type="tool")
def answer_question(prompt: str) -> str:  # replace with your LLM system calls
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

@judgment.observe(span_type="function")
def run_agent(question: str) -> str:
    task = format_task(question)
    answer = answer_question(task)

    # Add online evaluation with server-hosted scorer
    judgment.async_evaluate(
        scorer=HelpfulnessScorer(),
        example=QuestionAnswer(question=question, answer=answer),
        sampling_rate=0.9  # Evaluate 90% of agent runs
    )

    return answer

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = run_agent("What is the capital of the United States?")
    print(result)
```

Congratulations! Your online eval result should look like this:

![Custom Scorer Online ABM](assets/custom_scorer_online_abm.png)

You can now run any online scorer in a virtualized container with no latency impact on your applications.

<!--
```python
from judgeval.tracer import Tracer, wrap
from judgeval.data import Example
from judgeval.scorers.example_scorer import ExampleScorer
from openai import OpenAI

judgment = Tracer(project_name="default_project")
client = wrap(OpenAI())

class CustomerRequest(Example):  # Define a custom example class
    request: str
    response: str

class ResolutionScorer(ExampleScorer):  # Define a agent-specific custom scorer
    name: str = "Resolution Scorer"
    server_hosted: bool = True  # Executes scorer in a virtualized secure container

    async def a_score_example(self, example: CustomerRequest):
      # Custom scoring logic for agent behavior. Import dependencies, combine LLM judge with logic, and more
        if "package" in example.response.lower():  
            self.reason = "The response addresses the package inquiry"
            return 1.0
        else:
            self.reason = "The response does not address the package inquiry"
            return 0.0


@judgment.observe(span_type="function")
def run_agent():
    customer_request = "When is my package coming?" # fill in with actual customer request
    response = "Your pizza is coming in 10 days!" # fill in with actual agent invocation

    # Run online evaluation with custom scorer
    judgment.async_evaluate(
        scorer=ResolutionScorer(threshold=0.8),
        example=CustomerRequest(
            request=customer_request,
            response=response
        )
    )
    return response

run_agent()
```
