# Installation 

<CodeGroup>
```Shell Python
pip install judgeval
```
```Shell Typescript
npm install judgeval
```
</CodeGroup>

Judgeval runs evaluations that you can manage inside the library. Additionally, you should analyze and manage your evaluations, datasets, and metrics on 
the natively-integrated [Judgment Platform](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/register), an all-in-one suite for LLM system evaluation.

<Tip>
Our team is always making new releases of the `judgeval` package! 
To get the latest Python version, run `pip install --upgrade judgeval`. 
To get the latest Typescript version, run `npm update judgeval`.
You can follow our latest updates via our [GitHub](https://github.com/judgmentlabs).

# Create Your First Experiment

<CodeGroup>
```Python Python
from judgeval import JudgmentClient
from judgeval.data import Example
from judgeval.scorers import FaithfulnessScorer

client = JudgmentClient()

example = Example(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    actual_output="We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost.",
    retrieval_context=["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."],
)

scorer = FaithfulnessScorer(threshold=0.5)
results = client.run_evaluation(
    examples=[example],
    scorers=[scorer],
    model="gpt-4o",
)
print(results)
```
```Typescript Typescript
import { JudgmentClient, ExampleBuilder, FaithfulnessScorer, logger } from 'judgeval';

async function runFirstExperiment() { // Wrap in async function for await
    const client = JudgmentClient.getInstance();

    const example = new ExampleBuilder()
        .input("What if these shoes don't fit?")
        .actualOutput("We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost.")
        .context(["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."])
        .build();

    const scorer = new FaithfulnessScorer(0.5);
    const results = await client.evaluate({
        examples: [example],
        scorers: [scorer],
        model: "gpt-4o",
        projectName: "my-first-ts-project", // Example project name
        evalName: "first-ts-experiment"   // Example eval name
    });
    logger.print(results);
}

runFirstExperiment(); // Call the async function
```
</CodeGroup>

Congratulations! Your evaluation should have passed. Let's break down what happened.

- The variable `input` mimics a user input and `actual_output` is a placeholder for what your LLM system returns based on the input.
- The variable `retrieval_context` (Python) or `context` (Typescript) represents the retrieved context from your RAG knowledge base.
- `FaithfulnessScorer(threshold=0.5)` is a scorer that checks if the output is hallucinated relative to the retrieved context.
    - <Note>The threshold is used in the context of [unit testing](/evaluation/unit_testing).</Note>
- We chose `gpt-4o` as our judge model to measure faithfulness. Judgment Labs offers ANY judge model for your evaluation needs. 
Consider trying out our state-of-the-art [Osiris judge models](https://cs191.stanford.edu/projects/Shan,%20Alexander_NLP%20191W.pdf) for your next evaluation!

# Create Your First Trace
`judgeval` traces enable you to monitor your LLM systems in online **development and production** stages. 
Traces enable you to track your LLM system's flow end-to-end and measure:
- LLM costs
- Workflow latency
- Quality metrics, such as hallucination, retrieval quality, and more.


<CodeGroup>
```Python Python
from judgeval.common.tracer import Tracer, wrap
from openai import OpenAI

client = wrap(OpenAI())
judgment = Tracer(project_name="my_project")

# With automatic deep tracing, you only need to observe the top-level function
@judgment.observe(span_type="function")
def main():
    # my_tool will be automatically traced without @observe
    task_input = my_tool()
    res = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"{task_input}"}]
    )
    return res.choices[0].message.content

# No @observe needed - automatically traced when called from main
def my_tool():
    return "Hello world!"

# Calling the observed function implicitly starts and saves the trace
main()
```
```Typescript Typescript
import { Tracer, wrap } from 'judgeval';
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Ensure JUDGMENT_API_KEY and JUDGMENT_ORG_ID are set in your environment
const client = wrap(new OpenAI());
const judgment = Tracer.getInstance({ 
    projectName: "my_project"
});

// Define the function that will be automatically traced
function myTool(): string {
    return "Hello world!";
}

// Define and observe only the main function
const main = judgment.observe({ spanType: "function" })(async () => {
    // myTool will be automatically traced without explicit observe
    const taskInput = myTool();
    const res = await client.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4o",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: taskInput }],
    });
    return res.choices[0]?.message?.content;
});

// Calling the observed function implicitly starts and saves the trace
async function runImplicitTrace() {
    try {
        const result = await main();
        console.log("Implicit trace completed successfully:", result);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Implicit trace failed:", error);
        // The trace should still be saved automatically on error by observe
    }
}

runImplicitTrace();
```
</CodeGroup>

Congratulations! You've just created your first trace. It should look like this:

There are many benefits of monitoring your LLM systems with judgeval tracing, including:

- Debugging LLM workflows in seconds with full observability
- Using production workflow data to create experimental datasets for future improvement/optimization
- Tracking and creating Slack/Email alerts on any metric (e.g. latency, cost, hallucination, etc.)

## Create Your First Online Evaluation

In addition to tracing, `judgeval` allows you to run online evaluations on your LLM systems. This enables you to:
- Catch real-time quality regressions to take action before customers are impacted
- Gain insights into your agent performance in real-world scenarios

To run an online evaluation, you can simply add one line of code to your existing trace:

<CodeGroup>
```Python Python
from judgeval.common.tracer import Tracer, wrap
from judgeval.scorers import AnswerRelevancyScorer
from openai import OpenAI

client = wrap(OpenAI())
judgment = Tracer(project_name="my_project")

# With automatic deep tracing, you only need to observe the top-level function
@judgment.observe(span_type="function")
def main():
    # my_tool will be automatically traced without @observe
    task_input = my_tool()
    res = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"{task_input}"}]
    )
    judgment.async_evaluate(
        scorers=[AnswerRelevancyScorer(threshold=0.5)],
        input=task_input,
        actual_output=res.choices[0].message.content,
        model="gpt-4o"
    )
    return res.choices[0].message.content

# No @observe needed - automatically traced when called from main
def my_tool():
    return "Hello world!"

# Calling the observed function implicitly starts and saves the trace
main()
```
```Typescript Typescript
import { Tracer, wrap, AnswerRelevancyScorer } from 'judgeval';
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Ensure JUDGMENT_API_KEY and JUDGMENT_ORG_ID are set in your environment
const client = wrap(new OpenAI());
const judgment = Tracer.getInstance({ 
    projectName: "my_project"
});

// Define the function that will be automatically traced
function myTool(): string {
    return "Hello world!";
}

// Define and observe only the main function
const main = judgment.observe({ spanType: "function" })(async () => {
    // myTool will be automatically traced without explicit observe
    const taskInput = myTool();
    const res = await client.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4o",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: taskInput }],
    });
    const actualOutput = res.choices[0]?.message?.content;

    if (actualOutput) {
        // Get the current trace instance from the Tracer singleton
        const currentTrace = judgment.getCurrentTrace(); 
        if (currentTrace) {
             // Run async evaluation within the current trace context
            await currentTrace.asyncEvaluate(
                [new AnswerRelevancyScorer(0.5)],
                {
                    input: taskInput,
                    actualOutput: actualOutput,
                    model: "gpt-4o"
                }
            );
        } else {
            console.warn("Could not find active trace to run async evaluation.");
        }
    }
    return actualOutput;
});

// Calling the observed function implicitly starts and saves the trace
async function runImplicitTrace() {
    try {
        const result = await main();
        console.log("Implicit trace completed successfully:", result);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Implicit trace failed:", error);
        // The trace should still be saved automatically on error by observe
    }
}

runImplicitTrace();
```
</CodeGroup>

Online evaluations are automatically logged to the Judgment Platform as part of your traces. You can view them by navigating to your trace and clicking on the 
trace span that contains the online evaluation. If there is a quality regression, the UI will display an alert, like this:

# Optimizing Your LLM System

Evaluation and monitoring are the building blocks for optimizing LLM systems. Measuring the quality of your LLM workflows 
allows you to **compare design iterations** and ultimately find the **optimal set of prompts, models, RAG architectures, etc.** that 
make your LLM excel in your production use cases. 

**A typical experimental setup might look like this:**

1. Create a new Project in the Judgment platform by either running an evaluation from the SDK or via the platform UI. 
This will help you keep track of all evaluations and traces for different iterations of your LLM system.

<Note> 
A Project keeps track of Experiments and Traces relating to a specific workflow. Each Experiment contains a set of Scorers that have been run on a set of Examples.
</Note>

2. You can create separate Experiments for different iterations of your LLM system, allowing you to independently test each component of your LLM system.

<Tip>
You can try different models (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-5-sonnet`, etc.) and prompt templates in each Experiment to find the 
optimal setup for your LLM system. 
</Tip>
