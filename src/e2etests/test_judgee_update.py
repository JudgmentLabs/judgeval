"""
Tests for judgee update functionality using pytest.
These tests verify the judgee tracking and limit functionality of the Judgment API.

The tests include both direct API calls using httpx and end-to-end tests using JudgmentClient.

1. Basic Counting:
   - Single evaluations increment the count by 1
   - Multiple scorers increment the count by (examples × scorers)
   - Multiple examples increment the count by (examples × scorers)
   - Concurrent evaluations increment the count correctly

2. Scorer Behavior:
   - Failed scorers still count towards the judgee total
   - Skipped scorers don't count towards the judgee total

3. Reset Functionality:
   - The count can be reset to 0
   - In a real environment, resets happen automatically every 30 days

4. Rate Limiting:
   - Users have monthly limits based on their subscription tier:
     - Developer: 10,000 judgees per month
     - Pro: 100,000 judgees per month
     - Enterprise: Effectively unlimited
   - Custom limits can override the tier-based limits
   - On-demand judgees are used after the monthly limit is reached
   - When both monthly limit and on-demand judgees are exhausted, a 403 error is returned
