title: Integrating with LangGraph
---
We make it easy to integrate Judgeval with LangGraph. 
By simply adding the `JudgevalCallbackHandler` to your LangGraph workflow, you can trace your LangGraph workflow with Judgeval and also see insights from the execution.

TODO: add basic understanding of langgraph and our prod

```python
from judgeval.common.tracer import Tracer

judgment = Tracer(api_key=os.getenv("JUDGMENT_API_KEY"), project_name=PROJECT_NAME)

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# YOUR LANGGRAPH WORKFLOW

handler = JudgevalCallbackHandler(judgment.get_current_trace())
set_global_handler(handler)

result = graph.invoke({
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content=prompt)]
})

TODO: add handler attributes here

```
