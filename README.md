## Judgeval: open-source testing, monitoring, and optimization for AI agents

Judgeval offers robust tooling for evaluating and tracing LLM agent systems. It is dev-friendly and open-source (licensed under Apache 2.0). 

Judgeval gets you started in five minutes, after which you'll be ready to use all of its features as your agent becomes more complex. Judgeval is natively connected to the [Judgment Platform](https://www.judgmentlabs.ai/) for free and you can export your data and self-host at any time.

We support LangGraph, OpenAI SDK, Anthropic, etc. agents and allow custom eval integrations for any use case. Check out our quickstarts below or our [setup guide](https://judgment.mintlify.app/getting_started) to get started.

Judgeval is created and maintained by [Judgment Labs](https://judgmentlabs.ai/).

## 🛠️ Installation

Get started with Judgeval by installing our SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install judgeval
```

Ensure you have your `JUDGMENT_API_KEY` environment variable set to connect to the [Judgment platform](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/). If you don't have a key, create an account on the platform!

## 🏁 Get Started

Here's how you can quickly start using Judgeval:

### 🛰️ Tracing

Track your agent execution with full observability with just a few lines of code.
Create a file named `traces.py` with the following code:

```python
from judgeval.common.tracer import Tracer, wrap
from openai import OpenAI

client = wrap(OpenAI())
judgment = Tracer(project_name="my_project")

@judgment.observe(span_type="tool")
def my_tool():
    return "What's the capital of the U.S.?"

@judgment.observe(span_type="function")
def main():
    task_input = my_tool()
    res = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4.1",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"{task_input}"}]
    )
    return res.choices[0].message.content

main()
```

[Click here](https://judgment.mintlify.app/getting_started#create-your-first-trace) for a more detailed explanation.

### 📝 Offline Evaluations

You can evaluate your agent's execution to measure quality metrics such as hallucination.
Create a file named `evaluate.py` with the following code:

```python evaluate.py
from judgeval import JudgmentClient
from judgeval.data import Example
from judgeval.scorers import FaithfulnessScorer

client = JudgmentClient()

example = Example(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    actual_output="We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost.",
    retrieval_context=["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."],
)

scorer = FaithfulnessScorer(threshold=0.5)
results = client.run_evaluation(
    examples=[example],
    scorers=[scorer],
    model="gpt-4.1",
)
print(results)
```

### 📡 Online Evaluations

Apply performance monitoring to measure the quality of your systems in production, not just on traces.

Using the same `traces.py` file we created earlier, modify `main` function:

```python
from judgeval.common.tracer import Tracer, wrap
from judgeval.scorers import AnswerRelevancyScorer
from openai import OpenAI

client = wrap(OpenAI())
judgment = Tracer(project_name="my_project")

@judgment.observe(span_type="tool")
def my_tool():
    return "Hello world!"

@judgment.observe(span_type="function")
def main():
    task_input = my_tool()
    res = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4.1",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"{task_input}"}]
    ).choices[0].message.content

    judgment.get_current_trace().async_evaluate(
        scorers=[AnswerRelevancyScorer(threshold=0.5)],
        input=task_input,
        actual_output=res,
        model="gpt-4.1"
    )
    print("Online evaluation submitted.")
    return res

main()
```
