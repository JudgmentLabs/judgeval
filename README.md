## Judgeval Overview

Judgeval is an open-source framework for agent behavior monitoring. Judgeval offers a toolkit to track and judge agent behavior in online and offline setups, enabling you to convert interaction data from production/test environments into improved agents. To get started, try running one of the notebooks below depending on your use case or diving deeper in our [docs](https://docs.judgmentlabs.ai/documentation).

Our mission is to unlock the power of production data for agent development, enabling teams to improve their apps by catching real-time failures and optimizing over their users' preferences.

## üìö Cookbooks

| Try Out | Notebook | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| Custom Scorers | [Get Started For Free] | Build custom evaluators for your agents |
| Online ABM | [Get Started For Free] | Monitor agent behavior in production |
| Offline Testing | [Get Started For Free] | Compare how different prompts, models, or agent configs affect performance across ANY metric |


You can access our repo of cookbooks [here](https://github.com/JudgmentLabs/judgeval-cookbook).

You can find a list of video tutorials for Judgeval use cases [here]((https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation-blue)).


## Why Judgeval?

‚Ä¢ **Custom Evaluators**: No restriction to only monitoring with prefab scorers. Judgeval provides simple abstractions for custom python evaluators and their applications, supporting any LLM-as-a-judge rubrics/models and code-based scorers that integrate to our live agent-tracking infrastructure. [Learn more](https://docs.judgmentlabs.ai/documentation/evaluation/scorers/custom-scorers)

‚Ä¢ **Production Monitoring**: Run any custom scorer in a hosted, virtualized secure container to flag agent behaviors online in production. Get Slack alerts for failures and add custom hooks to address regressions before they impact users. [Learn more](https://docs.judgmentlabs.ai/documentation/performance/online-evals)

‚Ä¢ **Behavior/Topic Grouping**: Group agent runs by behavior type or topic for deeper analysis. Drill down into subsets of users, agents, or use cases to reveal patterns of agent behavior.
<!-- 
TODO: Once we have trainer code docs, plug in here
-->

‚Ä¢ **Experiment with evals**: Try out different prompts, models, or agent configs, then test for improvement with any agent behavior evaluator. Visualize and compare results over time! [Learn more](https://docs.judgmentlabs.ai/documentation/evaluation/introduction)

## üõ†Ô∏è Quickstart

Get started with Judgeval by installing our SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install judgeval
```

Ensure you have your `JUDGMENT_API_KEY` and `JUDGMENT_ORG_ID` environment variables set to connect to the [Judgment Platform](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/).

```bash
export JUDGMENT_API_KEY=...
export JUDGMENT_ORG_ID=...
```

**If you don't have keys, [create an account for free](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/register) on the platform!**

### Start monitoring with Judgeval

```python
from judgeval.tracer import Tracer, wrap
from judgeval.data import Example
from judgeval.scorers import AnswerRelevancyScorer
from openai import OpenAI


judgment = Tracer(project_name="default_project")
client = wrap(OpenAI())  # tracks all LLM calls

@judgment.observe(span_type="tool")
def format_question(question: str) -> str:
    # dummy tool
    return f"Question : {question}"

@judgment.observe(span_type="function")
def run_agent(prompt: str) -> str:
    task = format_question(prompt)
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4.1",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": task}]
    )

    judgment.async_evaluate(  # trigger online monitoring
        scorer=AnswerRelevancyScorer(threshold=0.5),  # swap with any scorer
        example=Example(input=task, actual_output=response),  # customize to your data
        model="gpt-5",
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

run_agent("What is the capital of the United States?")
```

Running this code will deliver monitoring results to your [free platform account](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/register) and should look like this:

### Customizable Scorers Over Agent Behavior

Judgeval's strongest suit is the full customization over the types of scorers you can run online monitoring with. No restrictions to only single-prompt LLM judges or prefab scorers - if you can express your scorer
in python code, judgeval can monitor it! Under the hood, judgeval hosts your scorer in a virtualized secure container, enabling online monitoring for any scorer.

```python
from judgeval.tracer import Tracer, wrap
from judgeval.data import Example
from judgeval.scorers.example_scorer import ExampleScorer
from openai import OpenAI

judgment = Tracer(project_name="default_project")
client = wrap(OpenAI())

class CustomerRequest(Example):  # Define a custom example class
    request: str
    response: str

class ResolutionScorer(ExampleScorer):  # Define a agent-specific custom scorer
    name: str = "Resolution Scorer"
    server_hosted: bool = True  # Executes scorer in a virtualized secure container

    async def a_score_example(self, example: CustomerRequest):
      # Custom scoring logic for agent behavior. Import dependencies, combine LLM judge with logic, and more
        if "package" in example.response.lower():  
            self.reason = "The response addresses the package inquiry"
            return 1.0
        else:
            self.reason = "The response does not address the package inquiry"
            return 0.0


@judgment.observe(span_type="function")
def run_agent():
    customer_request = "When is my package coming?" # fill in with actual customer request
    response = "Your pizza is coming in 10 days!" # fill in with actual agent invocation

    # Run online evaluation with custom scorer
    judgment.async_evaluate(
        scorer=ResolutionScorer(threshold=0.8),
        example=CustomerRequest(
            request=customer_request,
            response=response
        )
    )
    return response

run_agent()
```

3. After your self-hosted instance is setup, make sure the `JUDGMENT_API_URL` environmental variable is set to your self-hosted backend endpoint

## üíª Development with Cursor
Building agents and LLM workflows in Cursor works best when your coding assistant has the proper context about Judgment integration. The Cursor rules file contains the key information needed for your assistant to implement Judgment features effectively.

Refer to the official [documentation](https://docs.judgmentlabs.ai/documentation/developer-tools/cursor/cursor-rules) for access to the rules file and more information on integrating this rules file with your codebase.
